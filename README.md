# Page Replacement Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive, browser-based simulator for visualizing operating system page replacement algorithms including FIFO, LRU, Optimal, Second Chance (Clock), and LFU. Features real-time step-by-step playback, animated memory frame transitions, configurable speed controls, and exportable trace data for educational purposes.

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 - no external dependencies required. Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser to start exploring how different page replacement strategies handle memory management.

## Features
- 5 page replacement algorithms with detailed step information
- Real-time playback controls with adjustable speed (0.5x - 3x)
- Random and custom input modes for flexible testing
- Live statistics tracking (page faults, hit rate, frame utilization)
- Timeline scrubber for navigating through simulation steps
- Export functionality to save trace data as CSV
